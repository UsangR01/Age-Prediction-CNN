1. Introduction

Project Overview
----------------

This project aims to develop Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for age classification using facial image data. The project leverages deep learning techniques to predict the age of individuals based on input image data.

Objective
----------

The primary objectives of this project are:

    Age Classification: Predicting the age group of individuals (e.g., ages between: 1-2, 3-9, 10-20, 21-27, 28-35, 36-65 and >=66).

Dataset Description
-------------------

The project utilizes a dataset of facial pixel data, including age, gender and ethnicity labels for each image. The dataset consists of grayscale images, and each image is preprocessed to be of size 48x48 pixels.

2. Data Preprocessing

Data Loading
------------

The dataset is loaded into the project using custom data loading functions. It includes image data and corresponding labels for age.

Data Augmentation
------------------

Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of the training dataset. Augmentation includes random rotations, shifts, flips, and zooms to improve model generalization.

Mapping Age to Class
--------------------

To facilitate age classification, we map age labels to age classes. This mapping function categorizes ages into predefined classes (mentioned earlier in the objectives section). The function is applied to the age labels in the dataset.

Data Splitting
--------------

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

5. Evaluation

Model Evaluation Metrics
-------------------------

Age classification models are assessed using several key metrics:

    Age Classification Accuracy: This primary metric gauges the model's overall performance in correctly categorizing age groups. It's calculated as the ratio of correct age group predictions to the total number of samples.

    Confusion Matrices: These matrices provide detailed insights into model performance for each age group, including true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

    Precision: Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions. It assesses how well the model avoids falsely predicting an age group and is calculated as TP / (TP + FP).

    Recall (Sensitivity): Recall measures the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases and is calculated as TP / (TP + FN).

    F1-Score: This metric balances precision and recall, particularly valuable for imbalanced datasets.

    Accuracy: Overall accuracy evaluates the model's ability to classify all age groups correctly, calculated as (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN).

These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of model performance, highlighting strengths and areas needing improvement in age classification.
Results and Performance

Here's a personalized analysis of the output from our most improved model:

Confusion Matrix:

Looking at the confusion matrix, I can see how my model is performing for each class. It's a handy table that helps me understand where my model is making correct predictions and where it's stumbling. The rows represent the actual classes, while the columns show what my model predicted.

    For Class 0, it's doing quite well with a high number of true positives (215 out of 236) and very few false predictions.
    Class 1 shows decent performance but with some room for improvement. It correctly predicts 139 samples, but there are also 40 false-positive predictions.
    Class 2 is a bit tricky for my model, with 90 false predictions out of 281 samples.
    Class 3 has a significant number of samples (819), and my model correctly predicts about 60% of them.
    Class 4, the largest class with 1147 samples, has an okay performance with a 61% recall rate.
    Class 5 and Class 6 also have room for improvement with precision and recall scores.

Classification Report:

The classification report provides more detailed metrics for each class and an overall assessment.

    Precision tells me how accurate my positive predictions are. For Class 0, it's quite high at 0.87, but for Class 2, it's lower at 0.54.
    Recall (or sensitivity) indicates my model's ability to find all relevant instances. It's around 0.60 for Class 3, showing that my model is catching a good portion of those samples.
    The F1-score balances precision and recall. The macro average F1-score is 0.65, indicating moderate overall performance.
    The weighted average F1-score is 0.62, reflecting that class imbalances might be affecting my model's performance.

Analysis:

    I can see that my model performs well for Class 0 and reasonably well for Class 1. However, it faces challenges with Classes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    The overall performance is okay, but there's room for improvement, especially for those classes where precision and recall are lower.

6. Conclusion

Summary:
---------

In this project, our primary objective was to develop and fine-tune a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the classification of facial attributes, including age, gender, and ethnicity, using grayscale images. This project aimed to leverage deep learning techniques to achieve accurate and reliable predictions.

Achievements and Outcomes

Throughout the course of this project, we have accomplished several key milestones and outcomes:

    Data Preprocessing: We started by carefully preprocessing our dataset, which involved handling missing values, normalizing pixel values, and reshaping images to ensure they are suitable for training.

    Data Augmentation: To enhance the robustness of our model and mitigate overfitting, we implemented data augmentation techniques. This involved creating multiple variations of our images through processes like rotation, shifting, zooming, and flipping.

    Model Architecture: We designed, implemented, and evaluated multiple CNN architectures. These models were tailored to our specific problem, incorporating layers for convolution, pooling, dropout, and batch normalization to optimize learning.

    Training and Evaluation: Extensive training was performed on the models using the augmented dataset. We monitored key performance metrics during training, including accuracy, loss, and validation scores, to evaluate our model's progress.

    Hyperparameter Tuning: We experimented with various hyperparameters, such as learning rates, batch sizes, and network architectures, to fine-tune our models and improve their predictive capabilities.

    Mapping Age to Class: As a preprocessing step, we mapped the continuous age labels to discrete age classes, simplifying the multi-class classification problem.

    Performance Analysis: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance using evaluation metrics such as the confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helped us gain insights into which classes our model excels at and where improvements are needed.

Challenges Faced:
------------------

    1. Resource Constraints:

    Limited computational resources, such as GPU availability and memory, posed constraints on the training and experimentation process. This sometimes resulted in longer training times and limited the scope of hyperparameter tuning.

    2. Data Imbalance:

    One of the primary challenges was dealing with a significant class imbalance in the dataset. Some classes had a much larger number of samples than others. This imbalance can lead to biased model predictions, where the model may perform well on the majority class but poorly on the minority classes.

    3. Model Complexity:

    Designing an optimal neural network architecture posed a challenge. Determining the number of layers, the type of layers (e.g., convolutional, recurrent), and the size of the layers required careful consideration. Overly complex models could lead to overfitting, while overly simple models might not capture the dataset's complexity.

Future Improvements:

While this project has yielded valuable insights and promising results, there are several avenues for future improvement and expansion:

    1. Fine-Tuning and Optimization: We will continue to fine-tune our models and explore advanced optimization techniques to enhance overall accuracy and convergence speed.

    2. Class Imbalance: Addressing class imbalances is crucial. We will experiment with techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation to improve predictions for underrepresented classes.
